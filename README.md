# EasyGrammar

## üìñ Overview:

Our project aims to develop an application that will assist users in improving their English language skills. This project is developed using **React**, **Free Dictionary API** and **OpenAI API**.

## üéØ Project Objectives:

Our objective is to create a website having the ability to help people who want to **improve their English vocabularies**. People can always check the dictionary and learn new words. However, learning a language, or vocabularies, is all about practice.
<br><br>Therefore, we create this AI powered English vocabulary website, allowing our users to search a vocabulary. The website will display the definitions, sample sentances, and pronounciation from Free Dictionary API to our users. 
<br><br>Moreover, we will use the word being searched to create an image from OpenAI API. We believe this will help the user to remember the vocabulary through visualization. Beside, users can practice their English writing by describing the image. Their description will be sent to OpenAI API for grammar analysis. In this way, the users can receive customised feedbacks based on the grammar mistakes they made, and our objective will be achieved.

## üöÄ Project Features:

- **Provide definitions**: Users can search a vocabulary and get the definition.
- **Sample sentence retrieval**: Users can learn sample sentence.
- **Pronunciation**: Users can listen to the pronunciation of the word.
- **Image generation and display**: Users can see an image generated from the sample sentances.
- **Check for grammar and sentence correctness**: Users‚Äô description will be sent to OpenAI API for grammar analysis.
- **Feedback and scoring mechanisms**: Users will receive customised feedbacks based on the grammar mistakes they made.
