# EasyGrammar

## üìñ Overview:

Our project aims to develop an application that will assist users in improving their English language skills. This project is developed using **React**, **Free Dictionary API** and **OpenAI API**.

## üéØ Project Objectives:

Our objective is to create a website having the ability to help people who want to **improve their English vocabularies**. People can always check the dictionary and learn new words. However, learning a language, or vocabularies, is all about practice. Therefore, we create this AI powered English vocabulary website, allowing our users to search a vocabulary. The website will display the definitions, sample sentances, and pronounciation from Free Dictionary API to our users. Moreover, we will use the sample sentances to create an image from OpenAI API. We believe this will help the user to remember the vocabulary through visualization. Beside, users can practice their English writing by describing the image. Their description will be sent to OpenAI API for grammar analysis. In this way, the users can receive customised feedbacks based on the grammar mistakes they made, and our objective will be achieved.

## üöÄ Project Features:

- **Provide definitions**: Users can search a vocabulary and get the definition.
- **Sample sentence retrieval**: Users can learn sample sentence.
- **Pronunciation**: Users can listen to the pronunciation of the word.
- **Image generation and display**: Users can see an image generated from the sample sentances.
- **Check for grammar and sentence correctness**: Users‚Äô description will be sent to OpenAI API for grammar analysis.
- **Feedback and scoring mechanisms**: Users will receive customised feedbacks based on the grammar mistakes they made.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
