# EasyGrammar

Project objectives:

Our objective is to create a website having the ability to help people who want to improve their English vocabularies. People can always check the dictionary and learn new words. However, learning a language, or vocabularies, is all about practice. Therefore, we create this AI powered English vocabulary website, allowing our users to search a vocabulary. The website will display  the definitions, sample sentances, and pronounciation from Free Dictionary API to our users. Moreover, we will use the sample sentances to create an image from OpenAI API. We believe this will help the user to remember the vocabulary through visualization. Beside, users can practice their English writing by describing the image. Their description will be sent to OpenAI API for grammar analysis. In this way, the users can receive customised feedbacks based on the grammar mistakes they made, and our objective will be achieved.
